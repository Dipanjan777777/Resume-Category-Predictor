## 🎯 Problem Statement

In today's competitive job market, HR departments and recruitment agencies process thousands of resumes daily. Manual categorization of resumes creates several critical challenges:

- **⏰ Time-consuming**: Hours spent manually sorting and categorizing resumes
- **🎯 Inconsistent**: Human bias and varying interpretation standards
- **📈 Scalability issues**: Difficulty handling large volumes of applications efficiently  
- **💰 Resource intensive**: Requires significant human resources and operational costs
- **❌ Error-prone**: Manual processes lead to misclassification and missed opportunities

This project addresses these challenges by providing an **automated, accurate, and scalable solution** for resume categorization that can process hundreds of resumes in seconds with consistent accuracy.

## 🚀 My Approach

### 1. 📊 Data Collection & Preprocessing
- **Dataset Size**: 25,000+ professionally curated resumes
- **Categories**: 25 distinct job categories covering major industries
- **Data Balancing**: Implemented oversampling techniques to handle class imbalance
- **Quality Assurance**: Manual verification of category labels for training accuracy

### 2. 🧹 Text Preprocessing Pipeline
Comprehensive text cleaning and normalization:
```python
def cleanResume(txt):
    # URL removal: http://example.com -> removed
    # Social media cleanup: RT, cc, @mentions, #hashtags -> removed  
    # Special characters: punctuation and symbols -> removed
    # Non-ASCII characters: foreign characters -> removed
    # Whitespace normalization: multiple spaces -> single space
```

### 3. 🔤 Feature Engineering
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converted text data into numerical features
- **Stop Words Removal**: Eliminated common English words for better signal
- **Dimensionality Optimization**: Balanced feature richness with computational efficiency
- **Sparse Matrix Handling**: Efficient memory usage for large datasets

### 4. 🤖 Model Selection & Training
Evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms with rigorous testing:

| Algorithm | Strengths | Use Case |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Random Forest** | Ensemble learning, handles overfitting | Final production model |
| **Support Vector Machine** | Non-linear classification | High-dimensional text data |
| **Logistic Regression** | Fast, interpretable | Baseline comparison |
| **Naive Bayes** | Probabilistic, good for text | Traditional text classification |

### 5. 📈 Model Evaluation & Validation
- **Stratified K-fold Cross-validation**: Robust performance estimation
- **Overfitting Analysis**: Training vs. test accuracy comparison
- **Confusion Matrix**: Detailed per-category performance analysis
- **Classification Reports**: Precision, recall, and F1-score metrics
